I'm Jinal Soni, a full-stack software engineer with experience building and scaling web platforms in the clean tech and spatial data domains. My focus is on designing maintainable systems, streamlining data pipelines, and creating responsive user experiences that solve complex real-world problems.

### Professional Background

At BlocPower, I contributed to multiple energy efficiency platforms used by government and commercial clients. I led the development of a city-scale mapping application to visualize building energy consumption, built asynchronous task queues to run complex simulations, and helped create a scoring engine that drove actionable insights for energy use.

Previously, I worked as a data engineering intern at BuildingFootprintUSA, building high-accuracy spatial datasets using LIDAR and large-scale data pipelines.

### Technical Focus

- **Backend:**&nbsp;Python, Django, Celery, RabbitMQ  
- **Frontend:**&nbsp;React, Redux, Mapbox  
- **Cloud & Infra:**&nbsp;AWS (EC2, ECS, S3, Lambda), Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Data & Pipelines:**&nbsp;Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Best Practices:**&nbsp;12-factor app principles, SOLID, Agile (Scrum)

### Education & Learning

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Albany, where I also served as a teaching assistant for CSI 535 - an Artificial Intelligence course. I’ve completed foundational coursework in machine learning and deep learning, and I continue to build on that knowledge through applied projects.

### Outside of Work

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading and playing the drums.
