### Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Networks  
**Tech:**&nbsp;Python  

A perceptron written using Python builtins to perform binary classification on handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset including implementations for back-propogation and gradient descent using sigmoid activation and quadratic cost function. Aimed at understanding the math behind how neural networks work.
